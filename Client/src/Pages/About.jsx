        Just Buy was founded on the principle that time is the most valuable commodity. In today's fast-paced world, waiting hours or even days for essentials is no longer acceptable. Inspired by the hyper-local delivery models of companies like Zepto and Blinkit, we built a network of strategically located "dark stores" and optimized our logistics chain to achieve a service goal of delivering orders within **10 minutes**.
